# AI-E-Learning
This project focuses on creating a platform that  utilizes AI for improved learning and blockchain for  holding certificates and documentation. The platform will be geared towards grades K-12,  with the main goal being to generate the most  efficient learning experience for each user.

# How to run code:
1. Clone the repositiory into a folder
2. Run the server by running npm start
3. Run the frontend by / cd client / and npm start

# AI Component:
Personalized experience for each user.
Machine learning will be used to determine which courses a student will likely excel in based on correlations.
Supervised learning will be used initially, and reinforcement learning will be used after users populate the AI E-Learning module.
Correlation between proficiencies in each subject will be a baseline, user data will be used to recommend courses that a similar user exceled in.
The ideal “similar user” will have identical learning habits and class taking skills as a user.
Use data from “similar user” to predict where user will struggle and where user will succeed.
Slow work on struggling classes until proficient.
Accelerate the student in their proficiencies.

# Blockchain Component:
Blockchain will be utilized through certificate storage using smart contracts.
Certificates will be course completion certificates as reference for prerequisites.
A diploma will be awarded on curriculum completion after a user completes a number of credits.
The data will only be viewable by the course recommendation algorithm and a user’s certificate will only be viewable by user.
